# String Bean
The featherweight responsive CSS Framework based on a 16-point system, rhather than the traditional 12-point system that other frameworks use.

The extra 4 break points give you greater control over the widths of content on your site.  Sometimes 12 is just too few, especially on a high resolution screen, such as 4K - at 4K String Bean comes into its own!
