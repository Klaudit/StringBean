# String Bean
The featherweight responsive CSS Framework based on a 16-point system, rhather than the traditional 12-point system that other frameworks use.

The extra 4 break points give you greater control over the widths of content on your site.  Sometimes 12 is just too few, especially on a high resolution screen, such as 4K - at 4K String Bean comes into its own!

## Example
    
    <header class="container">
      <nav class="row">
        <div class="column xsmall-15 small-15 medium-10 large-11 xlarge-12">
          <h1>
            ComaKey
          </h1>
        </div>
        <div class="column xsmall-15 small-15 medium-5 large-4 xlarge-3">
          <p id="Strapline">
            Powering the internet, slowly.
          </p>
        </div>
      </nav>
    </header>

As simple as that!  You should also check out the button functionality.
